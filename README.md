I started to develop experience from Korean localization for macOS SW.
my 1st project was MS MSN messenger and office user localization for Korean users.
that project was 2006 year. almost 16years old.

and that's was an amazing experience how I service my skills to near my friends and many kindly peoples.
and I wish to be a better person and engineer to give my knowledge and know-how to other people.
